How to use the Tip Calculator:
To use this tip calculator, you will need to enter the check amount (non-negative integer/decimal number) and your party size (> 0).
Be sure to enter a valid value for both one.
Click the "COMPUTE TIP" button.
Then, it will show you the amount of tip and the total amount each person should pay for a 15%, 20%, and 25% tip.
